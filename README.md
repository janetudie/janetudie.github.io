Jellyfish Semantics, by Janetudie (under construction)
===================

Hi, I'm Janetudie, a beginner at this whole interneting thing.

Welcome to Jellyfish Semantics! The website is powered by Jekyll, based on Poole, and hosted on Github Pages. The reasons behind the making of this website will be detailed in the blog's first ever post. I also host every code and markup syntax up in this repository, so beginners like me can learn from it (if they want to). If there are any experts in here, they are very much welcome to criticise my code and/or otherwise pummel my self-esteem. I'll be grateful, even.

Anyway, if you're a beginner, the files in this repo can be daunting. I suggest starting with index.html or functional.css and go from there. I tried including explanations for things that may seem tricky in the files, but if anything seems suspect shoot me an email and I'll see if I can address it!

Some questions you may have, or not (the answers to these would also be on my website):

**Who is Janetudie?** <br>
I don't like putting my real name out there (for reasons), but I am a recent college graduate in the early twenties with a major in Genetics. I go by 'Jan', or 'Jane' if you prefer, because 'Jan' is a substring of my last name and I... don't like my first name much. I'll tell you this - it's one letter away from vagina. Not a good name if I ever want to, you know, live respectably.

**What the hell is semantic jellyfish?** <br>
It's based on a quote from the podcast Welcome to Night Vale, which I used to listen to. The quote goes as follows: "There is a thin semantic line separating weird and beautiful. And that line is covered in jellyfish." I happen to like jellyfish (a lot). One day I might change the name to something more descriptive, but for now, it stays.

**Why are you doing this?** <br>
To learn, of course! To help other people learn, too, if I can. Right now I don't think I'm qualified to teach anything, but I'm always open to questions and you can reach me at jellyfishsemantics@gmail.com.

**Why web development/computer science?** <br>
Because I like logic puzzles. Because I really really like good UX design. Because there's an app I want to make. Lots of reasons, I can't pick just one!
