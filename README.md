Jellyfish Semantics, by Semantic Jellyfish.
"There is a thin line separating front- and back-end, and that line is covered with jellyfish."

This blog catalogues my personal foray into programming. More about this, and my posting schedule is available on the first blog post. I run this blog by the principle of full disclosure, so while I may neglect to mention some things in my posts (such as the extent to which I abuse stimulants when I write code), I will provide an answer if you ask.

Thanks to The Odin Project and MOOC platforms.
