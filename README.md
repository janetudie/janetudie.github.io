Jellyfish Semantics, by Semantic Jellyfish.
===================

"There is a thin line separating front- and back-end, and that line is covered with jellyfish."

Hello there! This blog catalogues my personal foray into programming. More about this, and my posting schedule is available on the first blog post. I run this blog by the principle of full disclosure, so while I may neglect to mention some things in my posts (such as the extent to which I abuse stimulants when I write code), I will provide an answer if you ask.

Very big thanks to The Odin Project, Coursera, and edX, for providing much-needed periodical kicks in the posterior.

As an aside, this website is created using Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages, after a steep learning curve in which I almost died through caffeine overdose. Hopefully it will all be worth it in the end.
